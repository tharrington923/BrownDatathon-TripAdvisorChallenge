In the TripAdvisor challenge, we utilized user behavior data to predict the likelihood that a given user will book a hotel. We employed the machine learning capabilities of Mathematica to investigate the correlation between separate user behavior features and the purchase decision. Our optimal results were obtained using a feed forward neural network with a single hidden layer programmed using TensorFlow and Python. We investigated the impact of training the neural network with both balanced and skewed training sets.
